Love2d is an interesting framework, but the likes of Unity, Godot or even RPGM MZ are much better for direct game development.
It offers a lot of flexibility and some intersting libraries, it's lightweight and might be better suited for some small projects. Roguelikes like Balatro (https://www.playbalatro.com/) were made with love2d, so it's not that bad I guess.


Might come back to work on this in the future, slowly adding on features.
