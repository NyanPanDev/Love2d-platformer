Love2d is an interesting framework, but the likes of Unity, Godot or even RPGM MZ are much better for direct game development.
It offers a lot of flexibility and some interesting libraries, it's lightweight and might be better suited for some small projects. Roguelikes like Balatro (https://www.playbalatro.com/) were made with love2d, so it's not that bad I guess.


Might come back to work on this in the future, slowly adding on features. Main menu is largely unfinished, no enemies are present, animations are displayed incorrectly (using spritesheets and chopping them up using love2d quads would work better than just loading individual images), no hud.
